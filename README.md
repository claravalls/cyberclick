The programming language used is Python. I have used Python 3.8 as the interpreter
The files contained are the following:
 - exercise1.py: code for the first exercise
 - exercise2.py: code for the second exercise, including both parts.
 - policy.py: class to store Policy information used in both parts of exercise 2.
 - input.txt: input file containing the password policies provided.
 - input_test.txt: simpler input file used to test the code.

To execute exercise 1 run the following command:
    python ./exercise1.py
    or
    python3 ./exercise1.py
To execute exercise 2.1 run the following command:
    python ./exercise2.py ./input.txt 1
    or
    python3 ./exercise2.py ./input.txt 1
To execute exercise 2.2 run the following command:
    python ./exercise2.py ./input.txt 2
    or
    python3 ./exercise2.py ./input.txt 2
